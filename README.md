30 Javascript mini challenges with different practice applications

These challenges are drawn in order from a course, I've coded along with the course to create the initial project walkthrough/tutorial.

I also added a personal mini project using what I've learned for integral purposes, which also helps me solidify what I've learned.

This will help me to show what I am learning as I'm learning on a daily basis.
